## Conclusion

K-Nearest Neighbors achieved 72.3% accuracy but demonstrated significant limitations for Alzheimer's disease detection, particularly with poor sensitivity (46%) for high-risk patients. The algorithm's instance-based approach struggles with the high-dimensional medical feature space and class imbalance present in the dataset.

While KNN provides valuable insights into patient similarity and case-based reasoning, its poor performance makes it unsuitable for clinical deployment. The high false negative rate (54%) poses unacceptable clinical risks, as missing high-risk Alzheimer's patients could delay critical early interventions.

**Key Findings:**
- **Lowest Performance**: 72.3% accuracy among all tested models
- **Poor Sensitivity**: Only 46% of high-risk patients correctly identified
- **Clinical Risk**: Unacceptable false negative rate for medical application
- **Research Value**: Useful for comparative studies and baseline establishment

The model serves primarily as a research tool and demonstrates the importance of appropriate algorithm selection for medical AI applications.
