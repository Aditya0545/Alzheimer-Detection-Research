# üöÄ Deployment Checklist

## üìã Pre-deployment Checklist

### 1. Code Preparation
- [ ] Ensure all code is committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Remove any sensitive information from code
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are listed in package.json
- [ ] Check that the application builds successfully locally

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Verify environment variables (if any) are properly configured
- [ ] Check that all required files are included in the repository
- [ ] Ensure .gitignore is properly configured

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Test the application locally with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Check responsive design on different screen sizes

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Vercel Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

### 2. Configure Project
1. Select your repository
2. Vercel should automatically detect the Next.js framework
3. Framework Preset: **Next.js**
4. Root Directory: **/** (default)
5. Build and Output Settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)
1. Go to the "Environment Variables" section
2. Add any required environment variables
3. Set appropriate environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### 4. Deploy
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for the build to complete
3. Vercel will provide a deployment URL

## üõ†Ô∏è Post-deployment Verification

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [ ] Verify the homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Test navigation between pages
- [ ] Check that all interactive elements work
- [ ] Verify API endpoints respond correctly

### 2. Performance
- [ ] Check page load times
- [ ] Verify images and assets load properly
- [ ] Test on different devices and browsers

### 3. Monitoring
- [ ] Set up analytics if needed
- [ ] Configure error tracking
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for This Application

### Python ML Models
The current implementation uses mock data for predictions when deployed to Vercel because:
1. Vercel's serverless functions don't support Python execution
2. Large ML model files (.pkl) are excluded via .gitignore

For production deployment with real ML predictions:
1. Deploy the Python ML models as a separate API service (e.g., Flask API on Render, AWS Lambda, etc.)
2. Update the `/api/predict` route to call that external service
3. Add environment variables for the external API endpoint

### Large Files
- ML model files (.pkl) are excluded from Git via .gitignore
- For production, you'll need to host these files separately or use a different deployment approach

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Check logs in Vercel dashboard
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify all required env vars are set in Vercel
4. **API Issues**: Check that API routes are correctly configured

### Vercel CLI (Optional)
For local testing of Vercel deployments:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## üìà Production Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Configure caching strategies
- [ ] Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- [ ] Implement incremental static regeneration (ISR) where appropriate

### Security
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] Set up proper HTTP security headers

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Implement logging for critical operations
