   # Machine Learning-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Abstract

This research presents a comprehensive analysis of machine learning techniques for Alzheimer's disease detection using a dataset of 2,149 patient records with 34 clinical features. Four distinct algorithms were implemented and evaluated: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The study demonstrates that Random Forest achieved the highest performance with 92.3% accuracy, followed by Decision Tree at 89.3%. The research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting machine learning applications in early Alzheimer's diagnosis.
